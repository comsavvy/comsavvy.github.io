### [**FestMart Sales Analysis Project**](https://github.com/comsavvy/festmart-sales-analysis){.external target="_blank"}

**Objective:** Provide a dynamic BI dashboard to present FestMart’s overall sales, profitability, and category-level performance, highlighting the influence of discounts and regional trends on revenue and profit outcomes.

**Approach:** Implemented advanced drill-down and drill-through functionalities for seamless navigation between sales, profit, and order metrics. Employed interactive visualisations, data ingestion, and cleaning processes to ensure insightful, user-friendly reporting.

**Analysis:** Recorded total sales of £2.30 million and profits of £286.40 thousand, led by strong Technology sales. Although the West and East regions dominated in volume, the South region revealed higher profit margins despite lower sales. Notably, minimal discounts correlated with higher profits, and seasonal peaks were uncovered, guiding inventory and marketing strategies.

**Outcome:** Recommended refining discount policies, particularly where deeper discounts reduce margins, while capitalising on high-margin opportunities in the South. Proposed leveraging identified seasonal peaks for timely marketing and inventory decisions. Advised re-evaluating the Central region’s furniture segment to address potential losses and boost profitability.

**Approach:** Developed a Scrapy-based crawler configured to store data in different formats (text file, CSV) and deploy seamlessly to Scrapyhub. All dependencies are managed through a minimal installation, requiring only Scrapy.

**Analysis:** Validated the extraction process across multiple news pages to ensure complete and accurate article retrieval. Emphasised maintaining a consistent structure that facilitates reuse and further development.

**Outcome:** Simplified the acquisition of Punch news content for timely reference and analysis, offering a modular and easily deployable solution for both local setups and scalable production environments.


### [**BehindTheName.com Global Names Scraper**](https://github.com/comsavvy/Submitted-Names-Scrapping){.external target="_blank"}

**Objective:** Gather user-submitted names, genders, locations, and country-specific descriptions from behindthename.com to create a comprehensive dataset reflecting diverse naming practices worldwide.

**Approach:** Leveraged the Scrapy framework to systematically crawl behindthename.com. The initial version targeted Eastern Africa, while the updated iteration expanded to all available countries, capturing each region’s specific information and descriptive text.

**Outcome:** Compiled a structured, scalable dataset of global name submissions, laying the groundwork for deeper analysis of cultural naming trends across numerous regions.


### [**Bank Institution Term Deposit Predictive**](https://github.com/comsavvy/Bank-Institution-Term-Deposit-Predictive){.external target="_blank"}

**Objective:** Construct a predictive model to assess whether new bank clients would opt for a term deposit, guiding data-driven marketing and engagement efforts.

**Approach:** Carried out data preprocessing with one-hot encoding, outlier handling, and scaling (e.g., MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler). Deployed dimensionality reduction techniques (t-SNE, autoencoders, PCA) to boost model performance. Employed a 90/10 train/test split alongside K-Fold and Stratified K-Fold cross-validation.

**Analysis:** Compared diverse machine learning algorithms—Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron, SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest—using metrics such as ROC, F1, and Accuracy. Investigated performance variations under Stratified K-Fold to address bias from improper data splitting.

**Outcome:** Identified the three most effective models, emphasising the significance of feature engineering, scaling, and rigorous validation approaches. Published a Medium article covering key findings and made the complete codebase and documentation available on GitHub.

**Approach:** Implemented a dedicated Python module (`Data` class) to streamline data handling and analysis. Allowed direct method invocation from the module for a more efficient workflow than traditional Jupyter Notebook. Incorporated built-in Python documentation features (`?Data`, `help(Data)`) for real-time method references.

**Analysis:** Reviewed water resource allocation and utilisation at each location. Assessed tap flow rates to detect consumption patterns and pinpoint opportunities for optimised usage. Employed modular methods for data cleaning, transformation, and visual exploration.

**Outcome:** Delivered a flexible, module-based framework for water usage analytics. This self-contained solution simplifies adaptation to new datasets or requirements, supporting ongoing research and evidence-based decision-making in water resource management.


### [**Autism Project**](https://github.com/comsavvy/Autism-project){.external target="_blank"}

**Objective:** Use exploratory data analysis and machine learning to predict autism status in children, focusing on features that distinguish autistic from non-autistic participants.

**Approach:** Investigated univariate statistics (e.g., box plots) for the first four attributes to judge their ability to separate autism and non-autism classes. Analysed data distributions across Australia, Germany, Italy, and India via bar charts, with discussions on alternative visual approaches. Built and tested a linear regression model using the two most indicative attributes (score, score2) to forecast autism status.

**Analysis:** Found that India constituted the largest segment of children in the dataset. Noted higher standard and alternative test scores for autistic children compared to non-autistic peers. Highlighted elevated testing costs for autistic children, suggesting potential socio-economic implications.

**Outcome:** Demonstrated the predictive value of key features and validated the utility of both simple (bar charts, box plots) and more advanced analytics. Established a springboard for refining models and further exploring autism-related variables in paediatric studies.
