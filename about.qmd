:::: {#about-page}

As a skilled data scientist with over five years of experience, I specialise in exploring, detecting, and analysing data to drive strategic decision-making and deliver impactful results. My expertise lies in leveraging advanced analytical tools and methodologies to generate innovative insights that empower organisations to achieve their goals. I am proficient in Python programming, Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, SQL, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Git, and Bash scripting, enabling me to excel in diverse projects requiring technical precision and creative problem-solving.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Education, where I graduated as the top-performing student in my department and was honoured with an academic excellence award. Beyond my formal education, I have earned multiple scholarships to pursue additional certifications and training, equipping me with a well-rounded blend of hard and soft skills. My passion for data science extends beyond individual achievements; I actively engage in the community as a facilitator, participant, and mentor at data analytics workshops, machine learning events, and AI forums. I believe in the power of collaboration, teamwork, and knowledge-sharing to foster innovation and support aspiring professionals.
